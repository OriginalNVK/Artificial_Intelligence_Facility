# Pacman Pathfinding Game

This project is a Pacman Pathfinding game that demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms, including BFS, DFS, UCS, and A\*.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system. You will also need `pip` to install the required dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Artificial_Intelligence_Facility/Project01
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the `pygame` library required for the game.

## Running the Game

To start the game, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Gameplay

1. The game starts with a menu where you can select a pathfinding algorithm (BFS, DFS, UCS, A\*).
2. Once an algorithm is selected, the game begins, and Pacman will move through the maze while being chased by ghosts using the selected algorithm.
3. Use the arrow keys to move Pacman around the maze.
4. You can return to the menu or view the results by clicking the respective buttons.

Enjoy the game!
